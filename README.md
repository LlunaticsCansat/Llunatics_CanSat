# Llunatics

Llunatics is a CanSat, a mini satellite that is the size of a can, designed and developed by a team formed by students of first baccalaureate in Catalonia participating in the Esero CanSat competition.

The team is constructed by 5 members, and we are not going to present the members and declare the location of our institute.
